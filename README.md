=======

A column based database and search engine on top of it. 

The column based database constructs a log structured merge tree efficiently keeping posting records on inverted indices. The search engine uses the database to search keywords from a set of documents.

This project is experimental and does not work at all at this point, it would not work at all even though you want to use it. Do not try to run it until I finish coding ;-)...
